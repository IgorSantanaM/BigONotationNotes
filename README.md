# Big-O Notation Notes

This repository contains notes and explanations on Big-O notation, a crucial concept in computer science and algorithm analysis.

## What is Big-O Notation?

Big-O notation is used to describe the time complexity or space complexity of algorithms. It characterizes the performance of an algorithm in terms of how it responds to changes in input size. It provides an upper bound on the growth rate of the runtime of an algorithm as the size of the input increases.
